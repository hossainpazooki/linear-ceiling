"""The one upstream-pin check every experiment gate uses.

An experiment records the upstream sha it was registered against. Later registrations may
re-pin the upstream (new scripts land there), so requiring HEAD == pin would make an older
experiment's summarizer refuse the moment a NEWER experiment is registered -- a false alarm.
What actually matters is that the TOOLS the experiment invokes are the pinned bytes:

  - the pinned commit exists and is HEAD or an ancestor of HEAD;
  - the invoked paths are unchanged between the pin and HEAD;
  - the working tree is clean for those paths.

Anything else there (the operator's unrelated local edits, later scripts) is not this
experiment's business and is not checked here.
